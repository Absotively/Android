My attempt to add some scripting to Android for Tabletop Simulator.

Currently, the murder, suspects, and hunches are set up automatically. The characters/players mostly are not. Nothing after setup is scripted.

To play a specific murder, place its bag on the tray with the "Set up" button, then click the button. To play a random murder, just click the button.

To play a specific character, place its bag on your tray before clicking the "Set up" button. Anyone without a bag on their tray will get a random character.
