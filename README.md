My attempt to add some scripting to Android for Tabletop Simulator.

Currently, the murder, suspects, and hunches are set up automatically. The characters/players mostly are not. Nothing after setup is scripted.

To play a specific murder, place its bag on the tray with the "Set up" button, then click the button. To play a random murder, just click the button.

Assets are from [KiRa937's Android mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=635916017).
